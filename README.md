# Flutter-Call 

Flutter project to make native phone calls from the flutter app itself. Flutter call is able to receive calls and able to make call. On the native side I have used Kotlin.

## Getting Started
First at the native level we have to make our app as a Default Dialer so we get permissions at OS level.
Second We have to make a Flutter Channel that is able to communicate with kotlin side.
third we have to get call making permissions that checks everytime is the app running as default?
Lastly there is a UI at native side for Call Dialing Screen or Ringing.
